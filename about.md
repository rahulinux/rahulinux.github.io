I’m Rahul Patil, and Linuxian.com is my personal geek blog. I simply like scripting,coding and helping others is a fulfilling way to stay up to date and give something back to the community and the web from which I learned so much.

Suggestions, comments, feedback and referrals are highly appreciated.
